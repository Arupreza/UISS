# Real-Time-Detection-of-Aggressive-Driving-Differentiating-Drivers-Styles-and-Cyber-Attacks

Aggressive driving is a leading cause of accidents, while modern vehicles face an increasing attack surface due to enhanced connectivity. Since driving behavior is often habitual, an effective detection system can improve safety by identifying risky actions and cyber-attacks and has the potential to transform driving habits for long-term improvements. This study presents a unified system for real-time detection of abnormal driving behaviors and cyber-attacks within in-vehicle networks (IVNs). Our system uses minimal CAN-specific functional data to identify aggressive actions such as abrupt braking, lane changes, acceleration, and cyber-attacks. It uniquely distinguishes between driver-induced aggression and attack-triggered behavior, ensuring precise detection of human errors and external threats and operating entirely on CAN data without external sensors. Our approach leverages a diverse dataset encompassing various driving scenarios, road conditions, and driver profiles to ensure reliability. The proposed system employs a specially designed deep learning architecture based on MobileNetV1, optimized for resource-constrained automotive environments. This approach achieves near real-time response with minimal feature extraction, substantially reducing computational overhead and ensuring high precision and low latency. Time-series analysis of CAN data enables accurate classification of driving behaviors and detection of cyber intrusions, reaching an overall accuracy of 99\%, with a threefold improvement in response time compared to earlier studies. This holistic solution enhances vehicle robustness against evolving cyber-physical threats, offering a cost-effective, energy-efficient method to ensure safety and security in modern vehicles.
